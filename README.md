# Phone-number
[![BCH compliance](https://bettercodehub.com/edge/badge/LuizFelipeNeves/phone-number?branch=master)](https://bettercodehub.com/)
This simple api using web scraping was created to get information about certain phone numbers.

It was written to get info from phone numbers, by not using a browser behind, it becomes much faster and consume fewer resources using cheerio <3.

OBS: for depending on an external service, this may break, but I hope this is useful for you to validate your idea.

Contributions are accepted, thanks!
